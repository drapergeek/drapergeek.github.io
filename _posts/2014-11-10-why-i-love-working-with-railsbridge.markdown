title: Why I love working with Railsbridge
published: true
---

I've been volunteering with [RailsBridge] now for 3 years. I started out just
volunteering as a coach and moved up to helping organize in [Boston] and
recently in the [Triangle]. RailsBridge has been one of the most fun and
rewarding opportunities I've ever had I'd like to share why.

I will be omitting the obvious answer here - "we need more diversity in
technology". That is the mission of RailsBridge and that should be your primary
reason for helping out. I'm going to list the other reasons that may not be quite
so obvious.

## You get to check your own learning

It has been a while since I've had the opportunity to work with someone brand
new to the world of web development. A lot of RailsBridge participants have
never heard the words we use daily such as 'DOM' or 'EC2'. When you're asked
questions about these things, you are forced to really stretch your
understanding of a concept to be able to simplify it enough to make sense but
not to the point that the answer is useless.

I have been forced to question a lot of my own understanding of how things work
after a participant questioned my reasoning. Having a fresh perspective on
things is always nice. Each time I've volunteered, I've received a ton of new
perspectives.

## You get to work with different types of users

RailsBridge brings in people from all kinds of backgrounds. I've had the
opportunity to work with founders of non-profits, secretaries who were looking
for their next career, parents wanting to learn to program so they could teach
their kids and PHP addicts looking to drop the habit. All the users have
different operating systems, environments, text editor choices and browser
choices.

In the Rails ecosystem we tend to have a very narrow scope of "mac or
linux". That isn't the case here, Windows XP is still quite prevalent on a bunch
of the machines that come in. I've spent hours installing Rails on a Mac OS
10.4. You learn to work with whatever they bring to the table. Having to
troubleshoot different environments reminds us to keep all those users in mind
when we're developing tools for other developers. We don't all use Macs!

## We get to be nice!

I've said for a while now that the point of RailsBridge is not to teach
programming, it is to be a commercial for those interested in programming. We
give those who are interested in programming the chance to see how awesome
programming is in a weekend and they can decide if they want to learn more from
there.

I stand by that point; but I think it serves another, possibly more necessary
function: to show others that the programming community is friendly! Most of the
people I've encountered in this community have been ridiculously friendly and
letting people new to our community see that can go a long way. All communities
have outliers that screw up the system, we have more than our fair share,
but getting all the people together who want to be nice and help allows us to put
our best foot forward and show that we want diversity and that we want to be
helpful.

## GIVE BACK

We've all been blessed by being in this community. [RailsBridge] allows us to
give back. It allows us to give someone else the chance to take part in a
community that I really love.

Explaining "rails server" to someone in a weekend and finding out a year later
that she went on to get a programming job has to be one of the most rewarding
things I've ever done. I can't encourage you enough to find your local chapter
and give back any chance you can!
