Ok, I really don't. I'm not a software developer to write code. I'm a software developer to help people. I like to provide a benefit to people. I like to make someone's life easier, make their job better or make their day a little bit better. I only care about software as a means to an end.

What does this mean? It means that I do care about things like proper OO
techniques and good tests. It means I do care about
