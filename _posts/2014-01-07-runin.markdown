Here is a quick ZSH trick I learned from my awesome coworker [Gabe
Berke-Williams](http://gabebw.com/). In ZSH, you can re-run your last command
using r.

```
bundle install
r #=> bundle install
```

This isn't terribly help until you find out that you can perform some basic
substitution on your command. How about the following scenario? You've
upgraded postgres and need to reinstall the gem.

```
gem uninstall pg
r unin=in #=> gem install pg
```

It is a small trick but can come in handy.
