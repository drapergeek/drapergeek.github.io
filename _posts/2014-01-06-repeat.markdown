This is a simple command I learned a while back. If you use zsh and want to run
a command multiple times, you can simply use the `repeat` command.

I have a problem in my test suite currently, there are a few specs that will
intermittently fail when I run the entire suite. This is a really big pain to
investigate because it requires running the entire suite multiple times.
Fortunately using the repeat command made it much easier. I done some work on
the test suite to try and resolve the issues, then I simply fire up a shell and
run:

```
  repeat 10 bundle exec rake
```

and then I go grab some more coffee! The test suite is fairly quick (about 2
minutes) so I can just let it run. After the suite has ran 10 times, if I don't
have any failures, I can feel fairly confident I've fixed the issue.

The repeat command takes a number as the first argument and then the rest of the
command as the rest of the arguments. An example of running a single spec 200
times would be:

```
 repeat 200 rspec spec/models/idea_spec.rb:25
```

Repeat is a great tool to have in your chest anytime you want to do the same
thing multiple times.
