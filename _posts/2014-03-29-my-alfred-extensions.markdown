title: My Alfred Extensions
published: true

I love Alfred. I use it for everything I can. Recently one of the developers at
thoughtbot shared his list of extensions and I thought that was a great idea and
I decided to do the same. Here is my current setup.

Extensions:

* [Omnifocus](https://files.app.net/2zwm2acCb) - I use a plugin that [Gordon Fontenot](https://twitter.com/gfontenot) wrote to quickly add items to my omnifocus list.
* [Dash](https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows/tree/master/dash) - For documentation
* [Day One Log](https://github.com/drapergeek/alred-dayone) - I like being able to quickly add entries to day one. This is a
  quick script I put together to use the command line.
* [Gif Filter](http://destroytoday.com/blog/gif-workflow/) - I like gifs. This allows me to easily lookup the gifs in my
  folder by their name.
* [Ip](https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows/tree/master/ip-address) - This is stupid simple but it is a great way to find my external IP
  quickly.
* [Kill
  Process](https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows/tree/master/kill-process) - Allows me to quickly kill a process. I don't use this a lot
  because I'm usually in the terminal but it is handy when a browser crashes.
* [Menu Bar Search](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1993-menu-search/) - Use alfred to hit any menu bar item! Crazy!
* [Open Project](https://github.com/drapergeek/alfred-open-project) - I use pow and tmuxinator which means that I can use this one
  workflow to open my terminal to the directories I need as well as get my
browser ready. This is great when switching between projects.
