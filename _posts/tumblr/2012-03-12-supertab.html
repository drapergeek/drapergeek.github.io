<p>Just wanted to put up a quick note here that <a href="https://github.com/tsaleh/vim-supertab">vim-supertab</a> is a sweet plugin.  I haven&#8217;t really looked into it fully but so far the simple fact that if I have MyAwesomeClass defined somewhere in my project, if I type MyAwe and then hit tab, it will offer to finish it for me, is awesome.  Check it out!</p>
