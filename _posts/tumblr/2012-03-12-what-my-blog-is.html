title: What My Blog Is

<p>Before I begin posting, I want to give a short explanation of what this blog really is.  I look at this blog the same way that most open source is viewed:  I am creating it for me and if it happens to benefits others then great!  I need a place to dumb all this information, if in the process of doing so, this helps someone out, that is awesome.  Sometimes when I describe a topic I may go into detail, most times though I will probably simply drop one of two lines in and move on just because its something fun I want to remember.</p>
