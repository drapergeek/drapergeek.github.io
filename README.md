# My Blog

## Usage

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll serve -w`

### Creating new posts
- `ruby new_post.rb 'POST NAME'`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. Most of them can be changed directly in
[_config.yml](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/_config.yml). That's
where we'll pull your name, Twitter username, and things like that.

There's a few other places that you'll want to change, too:

- [CNAME](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/CNAME): If you're using
  this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you'll want to change this
  to be the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a
  domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
- [favicon.ico](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/favicon.ico): This
  is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's
  address bar. You should change it to whatever you'd like.
- [apple-touch-icon.png](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/apple-touch-icon.png):
  Again, this is my gravatar, and it shows up in iOS and various other apps
  that use this file as an "icon" for your site.

## Licensing

This is [MIT](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/LICENSE) with no
added caveats, so feel free to use this on your site without linking back to
me or using a disclaimer or anything silly like that.

If you'd like give me credit somewhere on your blog or tweet a shout out to
